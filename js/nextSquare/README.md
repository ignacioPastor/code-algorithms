Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter.
Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the parameter is itself not a perfect square, than -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is positive.
```
N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * N
```
Be careful `1000!` has 2568 digits...

#### Examples
```
findNextSquare(121) --> returns 144
findNextSquare(625) --> returns 676
findNextSquare(114) --> returns -1 since 114 is not a perfect
```
