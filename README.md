## What Is CodeWars and Code Kata?
CodeWars is an algorithm testing site to help learn a new language, improve your problem-solving skills or prepare for a technical interview.

#### Code Kata then is a coding challenge to solve, paying attention more in the algorithmic solution than in the languaje you use.

## How Does CodeWars Work?
- In each algorithm you are given a description to solve.
- Tests given some public tests to view which means you can see the input and desired output. Hidden tests which can not be viewed are also given and will need to be solved. You have the ability to write your own tests for specific cases or to try and guess the hidden cases.
- As long you solve challenges you achieve points (kudos), in order to promote to more complicated challenges.

# Levels
CodeWars orders the challenges from 1 to 8 difficulty level.
1 is the hardest level and 8 the easiest.
Folders start its name by the difficulty level
